# Entity Tracking in Language Models
_Najoung Kim and Sebastian Schuster_

This is the repository accompanying the ACL 2023 paper [_Entity Tracking in Language Models_](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.213/). 


## Dataset

We provide the dataset in a password-protected ZIP file to ideally prevent leakage of the dataset into the training data of future language models. Please do not include the uncompressed files in any repositories if you use the data.

* Download: [data/boxes-dataset-v1.zip](data/boxes-dataset-v1.zip)
* Password: `iamnotaLM`

## Model Outputs

We provide the predictions of our model runs in a password-protected ZIP file to prevent leakage of the dataset into the training data of future language models. Please do not include the uncompressed files in any repositories if you use the predictions.

## Code

The directory `code` contains code for computing evaluation metrics and for generating new datasets.
